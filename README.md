# How to use this template

The **./source** folder contains the *development* version of the website, while the **./docs** folder the *production* bundled version.

## Basic usage

If you have *Node.js* installed, for a quick setup you can use the integrated web server which will serve files from the *./source* folder.
Install the development dependencies with `npm install` and then start the web server:

```
npm start
```

If you don't want to use the integrated web server, you can setup any other web server by creating a new host with the root path pointing to the *./source* folder.


## Site structure in brief

The main file is the `index.html`. This file includes some layout bits that are located in the `layout/` folder and the main application pages that are located in the `pages/` folder.

```
./source/
  layout/
      footer.css
      footer.html
      header.css
      header.html
  pages/
      home.css
      home.html
      home/ (folder with other files referenced in home.html/js)
         items_list.css
         items_list.html
         items_list.js
         items_list/ (folder with other files referenced in items_list.html/js)
      messages.css
      messages.html
      notifications.css
      notifications.html
      search.css
      search.html
  shared/
      input_box.css
      input_box.html
      input_box.js
      main_menu.css
      main_menu.html
```

A simple page is defined by the `.css` and `.html` files. A page might also require some bits of *JavaScript* in which case also a `.js` file with the same base name is present.

A page might also include some other *local* bits that are placed in a subfolder with the same base name of the page like shown in the above structure for the `home` page.

The `shared/` folder contains indeed bits that are *shared* across the whole application and that are usually referenced by different pages.

As you can see in the `index.html` file those pages and layout bits are loaded using some special tag attributes that are `data-ui-include` (to load simple content pages) and `data-ui-load` to load pages or components that also have a JavaScript controller.

**index.html** (main body)
```html
<!-- The header with profile icon button for opening the drawer layout (side menu panel) -->
<header data-ui-include="layout/header"
        data-ui-options="options.headerBar"></header>

<main>

  <!-- HOME -->
  <section data-ui-include="pages/home"></section>

  <!-- SEARCH -->
  <section data-ui-include="pages/search"></section>

  <!-- NOTIFICATIONS -->
  <section data-ui-include="pages/notifications"></section>

  <!-- MESSAGES -->
  <section data-ui-include="pages/messages"></section>

</main>

<!-- The footer with toolbar buttons -->
<footer data-ui-include="layout/footer"
        data-ui-options="options.footerBar"></footer>

<!-- The DrawerLayout used for the app-wide side menu panel -->
<div data-ui-load="@lib/controllers/drawer_layout"
     data-ui-options="options.drawerLayout">
  <!-- Add Navigation Drawer content -->
  <div data-ui-include="shared/main_menu"></div>
</div>
```

For a deeper insight on using these special attributes for component-based developemnt with **zUIx.js** see related link at the bottom of this page.

### The news list

In order to display the list of news articles, the `pages/home` is using the `pages/home/items_list` component.

**pages/home.html** (snippet)
```html
...

<!-- Top Stories -->
<div data-ui-load="pages/home/items_list"
     data-o-rss="http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss"></div>

<!-- World News -->
<div data-ui-load="pages/home/items_list"
     data-o-rss="http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_world.rss"></div>

...
```

Once the `items_list` component is loaded it will read the attribute `data-o-rss` of the element and download the RSS feed specified by it. Then it will parse the RSS feed and render it to the wrapping element.
This component is just an example and you can modify and adapt it to work with any data source or it can be replace with a server-side rendering approach.

### About the @lib prefix

The special *@lib* prefix is used with the `data-ui-include` and `data-ui-load` attribute to load components from a shared location that by default will point to the [zKit](https://zuixjs.github.io/zkit/) components library.
This path is resolved to `https://zuixjs.github.io/zkit/lib/` but can also be customized to point to a different location:

```javascript
zuix.store('config', {
    libraryPath: 'https://my.shared.components.io/lib/'
});
```

You can so create your own shared component library to use across all of your websites.

## Service Worker and Offline mode

A service worker is also included with this template. This is a script (`sw.js`) that runs in the background as a seprate thread from the main page and takes care of providing caching of most resources with a fallback mechanism in presence of network errors.
This makes the application to launch even if there's no network connection, like with a real mobile app. It also provide a configurable `404.html` *"not found"* page and `offline.html` page.
When publishing a new version of the application the *version number* found at the top of the `sw.js` file **must be increased** in order to clean the cache and correctly update the application files.


## Debugging

To enable verbose debugging information in the browser console, comment out the last line in the `index.js` file as shown below:

``` javascript
// Turn off debug output
//window.zuixNoConsoleOutput = true;
```


## Bundling

Bundling is the process of collecting all resources used in a page and then compiling them into a single and optimized file.

This will drastically narrow down the number of network requests the browser will make to complete the page loading, thus resulting in a faster startup.

There are actually two way of doing this:

- **In-Browser** bundler:
this method does not require any build tool nor plugins, it just works in the browser as-is.

- **Web-Starter** bundler:
is the [zuix-web-starter](https://github.com/zuixjs/zuix-web-starter) bare template, with a bunch of extra features and enhancements. It requires *Node.js* to be installed.

This template is already configured for **in-browser** bundling.

### In-Browser bundling

When the website is ready for production you can decide to bundle it in order to gain better performances. All of its components and resources will be crunched into a single file and loaded from memory rather than from network/localhost.

#### Step by step guide

Open the development website and generate the application bundle by typing in the **browser console** the command

```javascript
zuix.saveBundle()
```

This will create and save the **app.bundle.js** file to the *Downloads* folder.

Copy all files from the *source* folder to the **production** folder (*./docs*) with the exception of *./components*, *./controllers*, *./pages*, *./layout* and *./index.css*.

These folders contain *zuix* components and pages that are already packed in the *app.bundle.js* file.

Copy *app.bundle.js* to the *production* folder. Edit the `index.html` file in the *production* folder and in the `head` section replace the `js/zuix-bundler.min.js` script import with `app.bundle.js`.

```html
<script src="js/zuix.min.js"></script>
<script src="app.bundle.js"></script>
```

You can also remove all `js/zuix*.*` files from the *production* folder but keep the `zuix.min.js` one.

#### Remarks

When using *lazy-loading* only components loaded so far will be included in the bundle (incremental bundling).

To force inclusion of all components/resources used in the page, issue the following commands in the console:

```javascript
// disable lazy-loading
zuix.lazyLoad(false)
// force loading of all components
zuix.componentize()
// create the bundle
zuix.saveBundle()
```

Also external JavaScript libraries and CSS files can be included in the page bundle. In order to achieve this, remove the `<script src="..."></script>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">` and instead use the method `zuix.using(...)` to load the script/css.

```javascript
// Loading a .css style
const flaCss = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flex-layout-attribute/1.0.3/css/flex-layout-attribute.min.css';
zuix.using('style', flaCss, function(res, styleObject) {
    console.log("Added Flex Layout Attributes CSS.", res, styleObject);
});
// Loading a .js script
const momentJs = 'https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment.js';
zuix.using('script', momentJs, function(res, scriptObject){
    console.log("Added Moment.js.", res, scriptObject);
});
```

Place the *using* commands preferably at the top of `index.js`. You can remove from the *production* folder all files imported with the *using* command.
